# The Yanderemine54 philosophy

> Software. Better.

## Open-Source

Software and libraries should be free to prevent abuse. Software as a Service (SaaS) are good for companies but are bad for the user. End User License Agreement(EULA)s of closed-source proprietary software are a complete disaster for the user. They allow really bad stuff to happen because the user **CANNOT** sue the developer if they do illegal stuff. The problem is that the illegal becomes legal with EULAs.

This an injustice. Open-source lets the user see the source code and developers can modify the code and redistribute it freely.

We only use open-source.

## Pricing

Most of our solutions are gratis but some are paid. We also have buisness plans with some buisness-oriented features which are more expensive but have volume licensing that costs less at the unit.

## Support

> Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning.
