## Open-Source

Software and libraries should be free to prevent abuse. Software as a Service (SaaS) is good for companies but are bad for the user. End User License Agreements(EULAs) of closed-source proprietary software are a complete disaster for the user. They allow really bad stuff to happen because the user **CANNOT** sue the developer if they do illegal stuff. The problem is that the illegal becomes legal with EULAs.

This an injustice. Open-source lets the user see the source code and developers can modify the code and redistribute it freely. [Learn more...](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary.html)
